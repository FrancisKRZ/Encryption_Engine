2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
25 out of 25 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: i_clk, i_key[0], i_key[1], i_key[2], i_key[3], i_key[4], i_key[5],
i_key[6], i_key[7], i_rst, i_spi_miso, i_start, o_done,
o_encrypted_data[7:0], o_spi_clk (the first 15 of 18 listed).
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
25 out of 25 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: i_clk, i_key[0], i_key[1], i_key[2], i_key[3], i_key[4], i_key[5],
i_key[6], i_key[7], i_rst, i_spi_miso, i_start, o_done,
o_encrypted_data[7:0], o_spi_clk (the first 15 of 18 listed).
Related violations: <none>

RBOR-1#1 Warning
RAMB output registers  
RAMB fifo_inst/ram_reg output DOB (8) is connected to asynchronous registers, if you use synchronous controls you will get better results both in area and delay (RAMB has synchronous registers built in).
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 fifo_inst/ram_reg has an input control pin fifo_inst/ram_reg/ENARDEN (net: fifo_inst/p_0_in_0[1]) which is driven by a register (spi_ctrl/o_done_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 fifo_inst/ram_reg has an input control pin fifo_inst/ram_reg/ENBWREN (net: fifo_inst/ram_reg_i_2_n_0) which is driven by a register (enc_engine/o_done_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
